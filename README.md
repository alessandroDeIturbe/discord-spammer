## How can I use this spammer?

You can use it downloading the release for your OS at [this link](https://github.com/alessandroDeIturbe/discord-spammer/releases).

The terminal interface is very user-friendly, so you can't have trobles with this, but in case, you can always tell me your problems at the [Issues Page](https://github.com/alessandroDeIturbe/discord-spammer/issues).

Don't abuse and have fun!
